Components are the building blocks of a design system, and their public API is a series of props.
Let's consider a button component and what its props API might look like.

It will likely have variants like primary, secondary, and link, and states like loading, disabled,
and error. In addition to those props APIs there could be other props exposed including size.

## Documenting a component

The best kind of component is a documented component, so we'll often start off with some
type of example usage for a component.

```jsx
<Button variant="primary" size="lg">
  Hello, world!
</Button>
```

In addition we'll typically see a table of the possible values for the props:

| Prop      | Values                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `variant` | `primary`, `secondary`, `link` |
| `state`   | `loading`, `error`, `disabled` |
| `size`    | `sm`, `md`, `lg`               |

However, this isn't very visual. How do these props affect the button's rendering?

## Rendering prop combinations

In order to visualize all possible props combinations, we'll often see each component copied over with
the new props applied. This is a great way to survey all possible outcomes of the button's appearance.
If we wanted to look at all sizes we might copy the JSX code (or manually apply design tool symbols
to side by side buttons):

```jsx
<h2>Button size</h2>
<Button size="s">Hello, world!</Button>
<Button size="m">Hello, world!</Button>
<Button size="l">Hello, world!</Button>
```

Not bad. We can quickly see the different sizes available and we get the benefit of seeing them in relation
to each other. However, **we're manually doing the computer is good at. Computation.**

If we surface all props and their values (like above in our props table), we can compute all possible
button variations. This also ensures that all button specimens are displayed when props and their
possible values are added and removed.

Otherwise, If you add another size, you need to manually update the documentation. You'll also notice, that
with only three props with three possible values each, there are a lot of possible values.

There are **27 variations** to be exact.

## The Cartesian product

In mathematics, there is the _Cartesian product_, which lends itself nicely to displaying all possible
props combinations. The Cartesian product of two or more sets, is the resulting set of all _ordered pairs_.

### Ordered pairs

The ordered pair is an important distinction because we want the _permutation_ of all possible props.

With combinations, order doesn't matter, so _1234_ and _4321_ represent the same value. With permutations, the
order matters just like it would in a keypad. If your phone's unlock code is _1234_, typing in _4321_
wouldn't work because order is significant.

This order property in Cartesian products is advantageous because we don't want the same prop combinations
with different ordering. Consider JSX, the following two code snippets will render the same thing:

- `<Button size="lg" variant="primary" />`
- `<Button variant="primary" size="lg" />`

### Calculating the Cartesian product

The Cartesian product between sets _A_ and _B_ looks like the following in mathematical notation:

_A × B = { (a, b) | a ∈ A and b ∈ B }_

It looks a bit intimidating, but it essentially means that if _A_ is represented as rows in
a table, while _B_ is columns, you can combine them. All new table cells are part of the
resulting set, the Cartesian product.

| `variant × size` |              `sm` |              `md` |              `lg` |
| ---------------- | ----------------: | ----------------: | ----------------: |
| **`primary`**    |   `primary`, `sm` |   `primary`, `md` |   `primary`, `lg` |
| **`secondary`**  | `secondary`, `sm` | `secondary`, `md` | `secondary`, `lg` |
| **`link`**       |     `link`, `sm`, |      `link`, `md` |      `link`, `lg` |

Which can then be represented as JSX code using our Button component:

- `<Button variant="primary" size="sm" />`
- `<Button variant="primary" size="md" />`
- `<Button variant="primary" size="lg" />`
- `<Button variant="secondary" size="sm" />`
- `<Button variant="secondary" size="md" />`
- `<Button variant="secondary" size="lg" />`
- `<Button variant="link" size="sm" />`
- `<Button variant="link" size="md" />`
- `<Button variant="link" size="lg" />`

## Building a Cartesian component

First, let's consider what an ergonomic API might look like
for a Cartesian component. It'd need to accept the component,
and then a collection of props with their possible values.

```js
import React from 'react'
import Cartesian from '../src/design-system/cartesian'
import Button from '../src/button'

export default () => (
  <Cartesian
    component={Button}
    variant={['primary', 'secondary', 'link']}
    state={['loading', 'error', 'disabled']}
    size={['sm', 'md', 'lg']}
  />
)
```

An implementation would look something similar to:

```js
import React, { Fragment } from 'react'
import { cartesianProduct } from './util'

export default ({ component, container = Fragment, ...props }) => {
  const combinations = cartesianProduct(props)
  const Component = component
  const Container = container

  return (
    <Fragment>
      {combinations.map((props, i) => (
        <Container key={i}>
          <Component {...props} />
        </Container>
      ))}
    </Fragment>
  )
}
```

Then, we'll result all possible component prop combinations that are rendered:

Lastly, imagine if in your documentation the possible props were statically extracted
from the component's source code. You can then forward it along to the Cartesian component
as part of some docs generation step.

```js
// ...
export default props => <Cartesian component={Button} {...props.propTypes} />
```

## Conclusion

There are a lot of interesting things we can do when we start thinking about computational design
and generative documentation. The Cartesian component is a pretty simple, yet powerful, usage of
this new way of thinking.

In fact, we can automate displaying component variations so we can better diagnose what combinations
cause issues and better documenting aspects of a component's implementation.

Another interesting usage of the Cartesian product is being able to quickly select a component
variation from all possibilities when working inside a design or development tool.
