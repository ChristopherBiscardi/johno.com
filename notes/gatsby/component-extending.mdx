# Extending Components in Themes

[Component Shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-03-11-gatsby-themes-roadmap/#component-shadowing)
provides a powerful API for customizing the rendering of components
and even entire pages. For example, changing the logo might involve
shadowing that component by creating your custom implementation
in a file named `src/gatsby-theme-blog/components/logo.js`. Now,
with recent improvements shipped to Gatsby core, you can _extend_
any component or file in the `src` directory.

This means that you can import the component you're shadowing and
then render it. Consider a scenario where you have a custom Card
component that you want to wrap the author's bio in.

Before component extending was added this meant you had to copy over
the entire component implementation from the theme to wrap it with
your Card which might look something like:

```js:title=src/gatsby-theme-blog/components/author.js
import React from 'react'
import { Avatar, MediaObject, Icon } from 'gatsby-theme-blog'
import Card from '../components/card'

export default ({ name, bio, avatar, twitterUrl, githubUrl }) => (
  <Card>
    <MediaObject>
      <Avatar {...avatar} />
      <div>
        <h3>{name}</h3>
        <p>{bio}</p>
        <a href={twitterUrl}>
          <Icon name="twitter" />
        </a>
        <a href={githubUrl}>
          <Icon name="github" />
        </a>
      </div>
    </MediaObject>
  </Card>
)
```

It's not terrible because the component is relatively straightforward,
but it wasn't the cleanest workflow to wrap a component or pass
a different prop.

## Importing the Shadowed Component

In the above example it'd be preferable to be able to import the
Author component and wrap it with your Card.

Now, that component extending has been added you can do the
following instead:

```js:title=src/gatsby-theme-blog/components/author.js
import React from 'react'
import { Author } from 'gatsby-theme-blog/src/components/author'
import Card from '../components/card'

export default props => (
  <Card>
    <Author {...props} />
  </Card>
)
```

This is a quick and efficient way to quickly customize rendering
without needing to worry about the implementation details of
the component you're looking to customize.

## Applying New Props

In some cases there could be a component with different variants
without an API to modify it outside of shadowing. With component
extending you can import that component and then add your new
prop to change it.

```js:title=src/gatsby-theme-blog/components/newsletter/button.js
import { NewsletterButton } from 'gatsby-theme-blog/newsletter'

export default props => (
  <NewsletterButton {...props} variant="link" />
)
```

## Change an Object

Another use case might be changing a `theme.js` file that a Gatsby
Theme uses to set colors globally.

```js:title=src/gatsby-theme-blog/theme.js
import { theme } from 'gatsby-theme-blog'

export default { ...theme, primary: 'tomato' }
```

This provides a nice interface to extend an object if you want to
change a couple values from the defaults.

## Conclusion

If you need to make a small change to an existing component or
add an additional prop extending the component you're shadowing
can be a useful way to achieve it.
