# Isolated Theme UI context

July 17th, 2019

When composing Gatsby Themes scenarios will arise where the
theme values, like colors and fonts, will need to change between
two theme usages in a theme composition. Right now
the Theme UI Gatsby plugin uses a single shadow location
which is used that leverages `wrapRootElement`.

This is the happy path for most users since wanting different
color sets between themes is an edge case. However, when that's
needed it can be achieved by shadowing a theme's Layout component.

For example, if you're using `gatsby-theme-notes` and
`gatsby-theme-blog` and want to change the text color on
notes you can extend the layout and wrap in a new provider:

```js
// src/gatsby-theme-notes/components/layout.js
import React from 'react'
import theme from 'gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/src'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'theme-ui'

const newTheme = Object.assign({}, theme)
newTheme.colors.text = 'tomato'

export default props => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={newTheme}>
    <Layout {...props} />
  </ThemeProvider>
)
```

It's a little bit of a dance, but it's not something folks need to
implement very often.
