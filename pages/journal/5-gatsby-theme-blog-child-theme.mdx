# Gatsby Theme Blog Child Theme

August 4th, 2019

Today I spent some time wiring up gatsby-theme-tosh which
is a child theme of gatsby-theme-blog.

Overall the flow was pretty solid and when combined with
the experimental theme-ui. Yesterday I wrote a quick Theme
UI preset, and then it only took about two hours to _completely_
customize all of gatsby-theme-blog to become something
pretty unique (and ridiculous).

It was fun!

Below are a handful of things I was thinking about while
building this theme out:

## Driving more styling from Theme UI

I wish I was able to more seamlessly drive UI styling from
my Theme UI config. For example, I shouldn't need to shadow
the blog header so I can adjust colors and padding.

Though, this brings up an interesting question around how
much _should_ Theme UI do? Layouts are often very custom
and bespoke, so it might not make sense there since we can
leverage shadowing. Though, I feel like we're missing the
ability to drive some more common theme tweaking from our
theme.js like container, header, and footer link styles.

## theme-ui only seemed to work in the starter

I haven't dug into why this is the case yet, but I wasn't
able to use the CLI tool from the theme I was developing.
It only seemed to work from the starter.

My guess is right now the CLI assumes usage in a starter
rather than theme under development. Though I think using
the CLI for theme development will be super slick when you
want to override a thing.

As others on the Gatsby Theme team have brought up before,
it'd be great to be able to determine the components being
rendered and automatically shadow them. It's much more
intuitive to look at what's being rendered for this flow
rather than looking at the filesystem.

## Sharing components between themes composed together

Right now gatsby-theme-tosh only supports the blog, and
when quickly looking at other themes, their component
architectures are quite different. This makes it more
cumbersome to add in support with those themes using
Latent Component Shadowing. I wonder if it's worth
defining an architecture for themes to opt into in
order to more seamlessly interop with official themes.

That way you can add in support for a handful of other
themes by crafting a couple exports using Shadowing.

This could also potentially be solved by being able
to drive a bit more from Theme UI or maybe some other
context built around layout.

## More granular components

Something I noticed was that I was often wanting to customize
the layout and container more granularly. For gatsby-theme-tosh
I wanted the layout for the posts list to be quite a bit different
than the post layout, but there was no way to easily achieve that
without shadowing the entirety of the two pages.

It seems like it will make more sense for themes that are expected
to be used as child themes frequently to have a lot more tiny
components rather than a handful of large components. This runs
contrary to the way I'd normally build a site using React, I tend
to prefer fewer, larger components for things doing presentation with
next to no logic.

However, with shadowing, the filesystem becomes the API so smaller
components that are composed together _into_ each page will allow
folks the ability to hook into different parts of the component
tree in order to customize and extend.

## Other random thoughts

- We need to be able to install starters from subdirectories. A
  GitHub Action workflow for a single, small theme is so cumbersome.
- Right now too much customization is done at the component level,
  it'd be dope to drive more from theme.js so we could have a Gatsby
  Theme Zen Garden type thing for theme/theme-ui.
- Having to restart the server for newly shadowed components is
  quite the papercut.
