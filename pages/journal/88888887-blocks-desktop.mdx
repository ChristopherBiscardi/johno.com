# Blocks desktop with Electron

July 18th, 2019

Today I began hacking out a proof of concept of a Blocks desktop app. So far it's turning out to work pretty nicely because the vast majority of the logic lives in `@blocks/editor` and the Electron app itself is sort of a filesystem wrapper.

For example, I have the following function to get file contents:

```
export const getFile = async filename => {
  if (!filename) return
  const code = await readFile(filename)
  return code
}
```

And similar functions for directory listings which is then rendered in React.

The `main` itself creates a browser window to render the React app from a static `index.html` and then handles file system writing:

```
ipcMain.on('write-file', (_, { filename, content }) => {
  if (!filename || !content) return
  fs.writeFile(filename, content, err => {
    if (err) log.error(err)
  })
})
```

The main app then talks to the main via `ipcRenderer`

```
const write = debounce(({ value }) => {
  const content = stringifyMDX(serializer.serialize(value))
  ipcRenderer.send('write-file', {
    filename: openFilePathname,
    content
  })
})
```

So far I'm really digging the overall simplicity of the app and the architecture where Electron is really a glorified web view with `fs` access.

## React Hooks

Being a proof of concept, I've kept nearly all the logic in `src/index.js` for rendering and am using hooks. At Compositor we'd written similar logic before

for Iso and it's wild how much simpler it gets when composing hooks.

To handle all directory listings, navigation, and file selection I have a handful of pieces of state:

```
const [openFilePathname, setOpenFilePathname] = useState(null)
const [openFileContents, setOpenFileContents] = useState('')
const [dirname, setDirname] = useState(remote.app.getPath('home'))
const [files, setFiles] = useState([])
```

And then a couple of functions that listen for changes in state to asynchronously update the file and directory selection

```
const updateFileList = async () => {
  const filelist = await getFiles({ dirname })
  setFiles(filelist)
}
const updateOpenFileContents = async () => {
  const contents = await getFile(openFilePathname)
  setOpenFileContents(contents)
}
const handleFileListSelection = async file => {
  if (file.isDirectory) {
    setDirname(file.pathname)
  } else {
    setOpenFilePathname(file.pathname)
  }
}
const write = debounce(({ value }) => {
  const content = stringifyMDX(serializer.serialize(value))
  ipcRenderer.send('write-file', {
    filename: openFilePathname,
    content
  })
})
useEffect(() => {
  updateFileList()
}, [dirname])
useEffect(() => {
  updateOpenFileContents()
}, [openFilePathname])
```

It's pretty rad to have that summarize all the fs logic aside from a handful of Theme UI components to do the rendering of the data.
