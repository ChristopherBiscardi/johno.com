# Component Shadowing and composition

July 16th, 2019

Component Shadowing is a powerful feature when building with Gatsby Themes. We've been using it in our officially supported Gatsby Themes, `gatsby-plugin-theme-ui`, and numerous other experimental projects. Here I want to break down a few scenarios where it seems to fall a bit short.

## Design tokens and theming

Right now, with `gatsby-plugin-theme-ui` we have what's essentially a singleton instance which wraps an entire app (via `wrapRootElement`) with the ThemeProvider which is used to provide theme tokens and even MDX/Styled components that can be used everywhere else.

For different areas of a site it's reasonable to expect a different design tokens, and even Presentational Context. Consider teams that might work on marketing pages, blog, docs, dashboards, legal pages, etc.

Maybe we use something similar to Theme UI color modes to address variations in themes?

## Shadowing content

One pattern we've been using in some themes is exposing things like author bios and sidebars as shadowable files. Let's consider the sidebar pattern I've been using in `gatsby-theme-documentation`.

> `gatsby-theme-documentation` uses a `sidebar.mdx` file to populate the navigation. In order to customize it you can shadow it by creating a file at `src/gatsby-theme-documentation/sidebar.mdx`.

Firstly, using an MDX file to be able to construct your docs nav as a list is a sweet workflow. It's nice to not magically abstract away the navigation to something handled in `gatsby-node.js` internals. It's also nice that it leverages Markdown in place of JSX so it's at least _a bit_ more approachable.

Example sidebar content

```
- [Introduction](/introduction/)
- [Getting Started](/getting-started/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/johno/gatsby-theme-documentation)
```

This feels really nice, but it doesn't work in all scenarios.

### Where it breaks down

Component Shadowing doesn't work when** composing multiples of the same theme**. You might be thinking, "using the same theme more than once?!?!?". Here's a contrived example:

Let's say there's an app that has multiple libraries in a monorepo and publishes a docs site for multiple packages. Each package has a separate sidebar, `contentPath` and `basePath`:

```
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-theme-documentation',
      options: {
        basePath: '/docs/package-a',
        contentPath: 'packages/package-a/docs'
      }
    },
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-theme-documentation',
      options: {
        basePath: '/docs/package-b',
        contentPath: 'packages/package-b/docs'
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Currently, with a shadowed sidebar it's impossible to have multiple shadowed `sidebar.mdx` files. Now, let's say we want to also install `gatsby-theme-blog` which has slightly different tokens. We're missing granularity that inevitably exists on large teams and websites.

### Microfrontends

For "microfrontend" usages can be problematic as well. It's easy to fathom scenarios where the same theme is being used in different ways throughout a monorepo.

## Fundamental lack of composition

Component Shadowing uses webpack resolution to resolve a file which means that attempted workarounds for composing the usage of the same theme won't work. The last usage will always win in the "shadowing wars".

## Potential solutions

If one-offs are passed to the configuration object it could allow for more granular configuration or shadowing. Spitballing here we could introduce something like:

```
query {
  allSitePlugins(filter: { name: { eq: "gatsby-theme-documentation" } }) {
    nodes {
      pluginOptions: {
        themePath
        contentPath
        basePath
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Another potential solution is to break up a large monorepo into multiple Gatsby builds,
but that seems like a decent amount of overhead and contrary to The Gatsby Way.

## Conclusion

Component Shadowing is a bit tricky when we have multiple usages of the same theme on a project. We lack the granularity for one-offs in content, design tokens, and variations in things like avatars. Since we use `webpack` resolution under the covers, shadowing is essentially global despite numerous "instantiations" in a `gatsby-config`.
