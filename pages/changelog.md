# My 2019 changelog

I was inspired by a post that [Jason Lengstorf][jason] wrote on [How to be Positive][post].
It's too easy to only remember and reflect on the negative stuff that happens during your day.
For 2019 I figured I'd write out some positive things for each day, forcing me to think back on the good things that happened.

Since I'm a nerd, I figure I'd write it in a changelog format for 2019.

### 1/1/2019

- :computer::art: Figured out a potential theming API for a collection of Gatsby themes I'm writing
- :car: Cleaned out my garage, something I'd been meaning to do for _a year_
- :hamburger: Dinner with family, daughter got to hang with the grandparents
