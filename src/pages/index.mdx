# BlackLivesMatter

In an act of solidarity with the Black Community I’ve taken my homepage
offline. I pretty much only write about tech, and tech can wait.
Tech is not a solution for the systemic discrimination and injustice
many folks are forced to deal with on a daily basis.

Black folks are being murdered by police with zero accountability,
with zero repercussions, with zero oversight. Lives are in danger.

… In 2020.

This isn’t right, our system needs reform. Institutions need dismantling.
The police need to be defunded.

Please vote.
