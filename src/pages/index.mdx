# BlackLivesMatter

In an act of solidarity with the Black Community I've taken my homepage
offline. I pretty much only write about tech, and tech can wait. Tech is
not a solution for the discrimination and injustice many folks are forced
to deal with on a daily basis.

This isn't right.

Our system needs reform.
