# Hello, I'm [John](/about)

I'm a web developer and designer that builds things. Lots of things.
I've built a few popular open source projects like [MDX](https://mdxjs.com),
[CSS Stats](https://cssstats.com) and [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io).
I'm also working on [Components AI](https://components.ai) since I'm
extremely interested in generative design and its implications for
traditional design tools.

I work at [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) helping to pioneer
a new era for building things on the web.
