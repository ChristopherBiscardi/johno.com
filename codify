## Computerization vs computation

We're barely in the computerization phase.

So much to gain from computation.

Pg 49: Ways to advance towards the future is to productize the process.

Pg 76: Mistakes in data entry of parametric design lead to new explorations

Need data sets for new models. Any kind of arbitrary dataset.

Turing landscapes, holy fuck.
